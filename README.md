# Journal Republic ✍️

**Journal Republic** is an open-source project where we’re building a Next.js app from the ground up, following a **code-first workflow**:  
1. Start with a simple MVP (built in StackBlitz for instant setup and GitHub sync).  
2. Iterate quickly on features.  
3. Handle the **design phase visually** with tools that let us style and refine components without being locked into code-only styling.  

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Create a space where we can prototype, test, and share ideas rapidly.  
- Keep everything open source so anyone can contribute.  
- Explore workflows that bridge the gap between **coding** and **visual design**.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) — for the core app.  
- [React](https://react.dev/) — component-driven development.  
- [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) — instant cloud dev environment linked with GitHub.  
- GitHub — version control and collaboration.  

## 💡 Workflow
- Development happens directly in StackBlitz (local-like dev environment in the browser).  
- Commits are synced to GitHub for version tracking and collaboration.  
- Visual editing/design tools (like **Codux** or **Onlook**) will be integrated later to style components more easily.
